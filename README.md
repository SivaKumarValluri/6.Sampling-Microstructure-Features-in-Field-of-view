# Quantifying-Heterogenous-Material-Microstructure
This software package processes segmented cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images to estimate features observed by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The primary goal is to analyze large microstructure images by superimposing randomly placed rectangular fields of observation and computing statistics on the features within these fields.
